# 57. RS - Record Separator

Assume you have the following text file which contains employee ids and names in a single line.  
`101,John Doe:102,Jason Smith:103,Raj Reddy:104,AnandRam:105,Jane Miller`

The default record separator used by awk is new line, so the following will not work as expected.  
`awk -F ',' '{ print $2 }' employee-one-line.txt`  
=> _John Doe:102_

Specify the record separator to colon to treat this as 5 different line.  
`awk -F ',' 'BEGIN { RS=":" } { print $2 }' employee-one-line.txt`

---

Assume you have the following text where records are separated by a "-" on its own line.  
And all fields are one a separate line.
